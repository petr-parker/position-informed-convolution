## Description

Research project by student of MIPT at Intelligent systems department.

## Abstract

This paper introduces a novel approach for robust curve detection in images, a task often hindered
by the high degree of parametric freedom in curve representation. Our method utilizes a multi-agent system,
wherein individual agents employ the Hough transform to identify potential curve segments. To effectively
consolidate these partial detections and account for their respective spatial contexts, we propose the
Positional Informed Convolution (PIC) layer. This novel layer extends traditional convolutional operations
by explicitly encoding the spatial location of input feature maps, thus enabling a more sophisticated and
contextually aware aggregation of agentsâ€™ outputs. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated
through experiments on a custom-built synthetic dataset, where we demonstrate significant improvements
in curve detection accuracy and robustness compared to conventional methods.
